# Triggered-Word-Detection
* Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  
* Trigger word will be "activate". Every time it hears we say "activate", it will make a "chiming" sound. I used activate because making a new dataset is a bit complex task.
